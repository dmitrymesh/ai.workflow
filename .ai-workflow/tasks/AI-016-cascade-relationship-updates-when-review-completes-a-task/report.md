# Execution Report: AI-016

## Summary

Implemented cascade relationship updates when a reviewer approves a task.
Approval now: (1) removes the completed task from every dependent task's
`blocked_by` list and clears the completed task's `blocks` list; (2) walks
the parent chain and auto-completes any ancestor whose children are all `done`.

**Round-2 fix (changes_requested):** `_cascade_parent_done` now calls
`_unblock_dependent_tasks` for each auto-completed parent before writing its
metadata, so parents that block downstream tasks are fully cleaned up when they
reach `done` through the cascade — not only when directly reviewed.

**Round-3 fix (changes_requested):** Replaced every silent `continue`/`return`
path for missing relationship targets with `raise SystemExit(...)` that names
the affected task IDs. Specifically:
- `_unblock_dependent_tasks`: missing `dep_id` → error naming `completed_id`
  and `dep_id`.
- `_cascade_parent_done`: missing `task_id` after approval → error naming
  `task_id`; missing `parent_id` → error naming `task_id` and `parent_id`;
  missing `sibling_id` in `parent.children` → error naming `parent_id` and
  `sibling_id`.

## Changed files

- `.ai-workflow/scripts/_tasks.py` — added `_unblock_dependent_tasks` and
  `_cascade_parent_done` helpers; updated `review_task` to invoke both on
  approval; added required imports.
- `.ai-workflow/scripts/test_cascade.py` — new file with 5 focused tests
  covering all four acceptance-criteria scenarios plus an idempotency check.

## Validation performed

- `python .ai-workflow/scripts/ai_task.py validate` → **Validation passed.**
- `python -m unittest test_cascade -v` (from `scripts/`) → **5/5 passed.**
  Tests cover:
  - `test_blocked_task_unblocked_on_approval` — A blocks B; approve A; B.blocked_by = []
  - `test_idempotent_unblock` — cascade on already-clean state is a no-op
  - `test_parent_closes_when_final_child_approved` — last child approved → parent done
  - `test_parent_stays_open_when_sibling_not_done` — sibling still in_progress → parent unchanged
  - `test_cascade_across_two_parent_levels` — grandchild done → parent + grandparent both done

## Assumptions

- The task was in `draft` status; moved to `in_progress` with `--force` because
  the human explicitly requested execution (normal path is `ready → in_progress`).
- `generate_board` is called once at the end of `review_task`, after all cascade
  writes, so the board reflects the fully-cascaded state.

## Known risks

- `_cascade_parent_done` re-reads each task's metadata from disk on each
  recursion level. This is correct (it sees writes made earlier in the call
  chain) but means a very deep ancestor chain will do O(depth) disk reads.
  Acceptable for the scale of this workflow.
- If a `children` entry references a task that does not exist locally
  (`find_task_optional` returns `None`), the cascade stops conservatively
  rather than incorrectly marking the parent done. This is the safe choice.
